# FB-messenger-analysis
Group project executed during studies with Ada GÄ…ssowska and Wojciech Szczypek.
app working on sample data: https://piotrf.shinyapps.io/Messenger_visualization/
### Project aim
Interactive visualization of personal fb messenger data in shiny app.
### How does it work?
After downloading data from our facebook account this app will allow us to create interactive visualization of our messenger analysis.
- python script: collects and filter data from downloaded data dump, creates a data frame as csv file
- R script: collects all scripts which had been used to carry out the analysis from data frame, creates csv files 
used by shiny app
- App.R script: shiny script with final visualization
### TODO
Make app user-friendly: reduce needed steps to running python script and opening shiny app.
(Currently it is possible to run app on our own data if you run above scripts and adapt them to work properly - mostly 
dealing with directory/files names)
Possible solution data reading/selecting module in shiny app.
